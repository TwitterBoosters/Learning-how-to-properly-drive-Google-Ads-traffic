# Learning how to properly drive Google Ads traffic

1. We need an anti-detect browser. Google is very fond of banning your accounts by hardware, so much so that then no bypasses do not help, so we will use antics. Of good antics I can recommend a free, reliable as a Swiss watch - Dolphin Anty. In it you can create several profiles and pour from several accounts at once, and you will not have problems with bans. Therefore - install it.

2. 2. In order for Antic to work, we need what? That's right, proxies! I advise you to buy proxies that are not cheap, resident, it is better NOT to ECONOMIZE on this, in any case. Because proxies for 20 rubles - die quickly and when you change the proxy - Google will detect and block your account. And the money you spend - no one will return to you, but will put it in their pocket.
Where do I advise you to buy proxies? Well, first of all, as a user of the forum - I would advise you to buy on the forum itself, because here it will be safe and in case of what - you will be able to open arbitration or ask for replacement/compensation for the proxy.

Accounts are divided into several types, namely on:
Self-registration - accounts that you register yourself, with the help of sms activations ( not the best option, we immediately discard it because of the high chance of blocking our account.
Rent accounts under the straits - also not the most wah wah way, very inconvenient and very unsafe. Therefore - also bye bye.
Buying an actual, clean, active literally ready product on a platter with a credit limit of
350$. That is, if clear and short - you used these 350$ conventional, poured advertising and account where? That's right! To the trash!

>To explain briefly. What cloaking is and what it is for.
Cloaking is a software that so to speak “masks” your gray, black traffic, including phishing.
This software shows the white side of your site to moderators and helps to bypass blocking. If you are going to spill ads on whitehat - you will NOT need cloaking.
Cloaking helps to increase the trust (credibility) of your site when publishing ads in google and will be seen on top of other ads in the top. In general, a very useful thing.

For bypassing the google system, which we will commit, most often at the end of the spills - we are given a ban, in this case - nothing to do, throw out the account.
For the topics we shed - under this category most often fall betkas ( casinos ), as well as in all other cases - throw out the account.
For suspicious payments - the most popular blocking, but which are subject to appeal ( unban) although with some difficulties. That is, for example, the geo of your account - Canada, and you paid with a visa card somewhere in Kazakhstan. In this case, they can also issue a ban.

What are offers?
In fact, it's quite simple. It's a catchy name for the ads
that will lure our furry ones in.
We can of course ask others to do our offers while we do other things, but it is better to think up and make offers yourself.
Here you need a pinch of imagination and patience. The first thing to do is to create a notebook on your desktop. Write in it everything that you shave into your head. Let's say a popular theme is Elon Musk.

*Coming up with offsets:*

- Elon musk shoked the other people
- Elon musk sayed how to get 0,2BTC!

And so on. Once you have come up with a few names, you should enter them on the Yandex site to check offers. Select the most popular of those you wrote, save in a notebook, we will need it later. That's it, the offer is ready, let's move on!

Well, here guys - everything is in your hands. You need to find the accounts I described above at a normal price and do not fall for scams
We need to find a verified seller who has lots of likes ( which means lots of money ), lots of reviews and an old account.
You can register yourself, warm yourself, buy a separate IBAN to buy advertising and do everything yourself, I do not recommend you this method, you will regret it.

First I will tell for those who bought an account with balik and registered RK ( advertising cabinet ).
After authorization, you will need to wait about 12-24 hours, just give it to "Lay", so that you are not thrown out of the account or more problems, especially bans. On the account of the seller I recommended - there is already warming up and you don't need to do anything but just wait.

**Now a guide for those with a different account:**

>After you have entered the site - click the "Start" button

>Next is the really important part. Budgets. Budgets should be set depending on the country you are pouring. For example: USA - 50-100$. Russia - 200-500P. Canada - 100-150$ all determined by the method of poking. What you pour country - such and budgets.

**IMPORTANT: specify a limit on the click price - otherwise your money will evaporate as fast as the mossy ones don't. Click save. Moving on.**

Keyword phrases are also a very important part of traffic. They will determine where your ads will be shown and how often. After we have done all the previous steps - we will be taken to another page. In it we will need to enter our site/domain and google will offer us suitable keys. There are two options: write the keys manually, or be smart and use third-party resources. We will go the second way.

The description of the ad greatly affects the CTR and traffic to your site. Let's go. After the previous action we will be redirected to a new page where we can edit our ad. In fact, everything is simple, just as with the offers that we thought up at the beginning of the article. We use the most popular words, names, description. Of course, you can steal the description from competitors, but it will not be unique and not the fact that it will have good consequences, we do everything ourselves.

Next, click ready and publish.

>Well, it's simple here... For those who bought an account with a tied IBAN or with balik at once))))
Guys who have all this - can already pay quietly.
And those who do not have all this - do the following actions.
IMPORTANT! In order not to get on the head - it is important to remember, 1 account - 1 card. Because it can be - ban

Here everything is much simpler, just register and install the wyte generator.

WhitePage is a key element in the world of gray and black offserts. Let's take a closer look at it: WhitePages are web pages that adhere to the platform's rules and help us successfully pass moderation while allowing potential customers to access our main offers

>How it works: WhitePage and cloaking technology work in tandem. When a moderator clicks on our ad, they see our "white" site (WhitePage), which complies with the platform's rules. At the same time, our target customer goes to our "black" page with our core offerings. This allows us to skillfully bypass filters and stay compliant with the rules, while attracting customers to our products or services.

Creating a WhitePage can be both a manual process and a task for professionals. (Whitepage can be purchased both on the forum and on third-party resources, but I highly recommend the shop where I bought it myself.) However, if you want to save time and effort, we have a great tip: we recommend using the @whitegenerator_bot service. Here everything happens automatically in a few clicks, including the choice of topic and language, and the created pages are successfully moderated. Try it, it can make your life in the world of traffic much easier.

What can I add about warming up? Well, to begin with, it's different for everyone. Some don't do it, some do it, but one thing is clear, it's very important. It doesn't matter what kind of account. From 12 hours at least. And after that - activity on it. How to warm up - for the most part it is up to you. I can't say more about warming up.
